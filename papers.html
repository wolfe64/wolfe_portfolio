        <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3FLDAL4Aw1Kgty2GOjfmAG4SdbvwzVM/edit">Appalachian Botanical Collection: Metadata Cookbook</a></h2>
        <div class="papers-content">
            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>Metadata is a crucial part of information organization. It provides bibliographic structure and control for data so that it can be stored and organized in a manner that is easy for both humans and computers to understand. This work sample showcases my ability to design a system to organize information in a way that is easily preservable and retrievable. This document was created to serve as a reference guide for data entry and copy cataloging for the Appalachian Botanical Collection at the Appalachian Museum of Natural History. This collection and institution were both made up for this project. The collection consists of botanical field manuscripts, pictures, and illustrations, all based on plant life found in the Appalachian Mountains. The document contains a brief technical overview of the collection providing insight into the metadata schema, encoding scheme, and CMS framework. It also describes the data content standard, which was created specifically for this project. However, the primary purpose of the cookbook is to provide the element set for the collection. This section provides users with the necessary understanding to properly represent data within the collection. For each element in the schema, the cookbook provides information and instructions on the following attributes: required, repeatable, Dublin Core equivalent, Darwin Core equivalent, an example in XML, and general guidelines for entry.</p>
            <h5>Analysis and Reflection</h5>
            <p>Overall, the metadata schema is well-structured and easy to understand. I chose to use a combination of Dublin Core and Darwin Core as the collection provides both cultural and scientific value. However, one thing I would change is the identifier element. As the collection was entirely physical materials, the identifier was a barcode that was placed on the item. The idea originally was that all barcodes would also be stored in a separate database table in addition to the table that would store data for this metadata schema. Within that table, would also be the storage location of the item. While I believe this idea is interesting, I think it could be too complex for users. Designing a collection of my own helped me gain experience in determining how to properly structure data so that it is easily organized, preservable, and retrievable. This project served as a fantastic thought exercise for what it takes to create a collection. Every detail of the schema needs its own special rules for how it is handled. It forced me to slow down and make sure each part is being properly evaluated.</p>
