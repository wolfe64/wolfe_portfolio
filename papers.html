        <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3FLDAL4Aw1Kgty2GOjfmAG4SdbvwzVM/edit">Appalachian Botanical Collection: Metadata Cookbook</a></h2>
        <div class="papers-content">
            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>Metadata is a crucial part of information organization. It provides bibliographic structure and control for data so that it can be stored and organized in a manner that is easy for both humans and computers to understand. This work sample showcases my ability to design a system to organize information in a way that is easily preservable and retrievable. This document was created to serve as a reference guide for data entry and copy cataloging for the Appalachian Botanical Collection at the Appalachian Museum of Natural History. This collection and institution were both made up for this project. The collection consists of botanical field manuscripts, pictures, and illustrations, all based on plant life found in the Appalachian Mountains. The document contains a brief technical overview of the collection providing insight into the metadata schema, encoding scheme, and CMS framework. It also describes the data content standard, which was created specifically for this project. However, the primary purpose of the cookbook is to provide the element set for the collection. This section provides users with the necessary understanding to properly represent data within the collection. For each element in the schema, the cookbook provides information and instructions on the following attributes: required, repeatable, Dublin Core equivalent, Darwin Core equivalent, an example in XML, and general guidelines for entry.</p>
            <h5>Analysis and Reflection</h5>
            <p>Overall, the metadata schema is well-structured and easy to understand. I chose to use a combination of Dublin Core and Darwin Core as the collection provides both cultural and scientific value. However, one thing I would change is the identifier element. As the collection was entirely physical materials, the identifier was a barcode that was placed on the item. The idea originally was that all barcodes would also be stored in a separate database table in addition to the table that would store data for this metadata schema. Within that table, would also be the storage location of the item. While I believe this idea is interesting, I think it could be too complex for users. Designing a collection of my own helped me gain experience in determining how to properly structure data so that it is easily organized, preservable, and retrievable. This project served as a fantastic thought exercise for what it takes to create a collection. Every detail of the schema needs its own special rules for how it is handled. It forced me to slow down and make sure each part is being properly evaluated.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3FLDAL4Aw1Kgty2GOjfmAG4SdbvwzVM/edit">Community Profile of Spartanburg Methodist College</a></h2>
        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>To understand how librarians can best serve their communities, it is essential to understand who exactly they are serving and what groups within the community may be under-served. This project conducted a community analysis of Spartanburg Methodist College to gain an understanding of patron dynamics within the community using measurable data. It demonstrates how I have learned to use data-driven methods to make critical decisions from a leadership position within a community. This was a group project done in conjunction with four other MLIS students. It serves as an example of my ability to work effectively as a part of a team to use data-driven techniques to effectively develop strategies for reaching out to members of the community and determining what groups need attention. We gathered and examined data about both Spartanburg Methodist College and Spartanburg City and County.  Most of the data we gathered generally was standard demographics that are often looked into with any community: population/enrollment, sex, race, age, household type, religion, and income. Data was also found for more academic information such as average SAT score range, average ACT score range, students living on campus, online students, and first-generation college students. We also gathered information on different clubs and organizations which the library could work with to promote different resources and events. With all the information accumulated, we could then go on to make general observations about Spartanburg Methodist College and the Spartanburg area which could be used to develop strategies to increase resources for the groups within the community that need them the most. </p>
        <h5>Analysis and Reflection</h5> 
        <p>Using this data, we were able to effectively evaluate the community and pinpoint parts of the community that may need more help. For example, Spartanburg was found to have a high rate of poverty. Even students receiving the SC Life Scholarship may likely experience financial hardship. Therefore, the library needs to provide resources to create a more equitable college experience for economically marginalized students. Furthermore, we were able to develop strategies to work with various groups within the communities to advocate the libraryâ€™s services and promote equity within the broader community. Building relationships with other groups can help strengthen community bonds and develop solutions to problems that would not be achievable on our own. 
This project provided a lot of insight into what it takes to understand our communities. Data-driven approaches as shown in this study help remove perceptual biases that everyone possesses and look at the bigger picture. By stepping back and looking at the numbers, we can objectively make the best decisions for promoting equity and inclusion within our communities.</p>
